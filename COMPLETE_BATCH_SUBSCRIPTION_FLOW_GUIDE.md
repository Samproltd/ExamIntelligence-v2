```

#### **Step 2: Create Subjects (assigned to colleges)**
```
Navigate to: /admin/subjects
Action: Create subjects and assign them to specific colleges
Example: 
- "Mathematics" → "ABC College"
- "Physics" → "ABC College"
- "Chemistry" → "XYZ University"
Result: Subjects are college-specific
```

#### **Step 3: Create Courses (assigned to subjects)**
```
Navigate to: /admin/courses
Action: Create courses and assign them to subjects
Example:
- "Calculus 101" → "Mathematics" (ABC College)
- "Mechanics" → "Physics" (ABC College)
Result: Courses inherit college from their subject
```

#### **Step 4: Create Exams (assigned to courses)**
```
Navigate to: /admin/exams
Action: Create exams and assign them to courses
Example:
- "Calculus Midterm" → "Calculus 101" → "Mathematics" (ABC College)
- "Mechanics Final" → "Mechanics" → "Physics" (ABC College)
Result: Exams inherit college from their course's subject
```

#### **Step 5: Create Batches (assigned to subjects)**
```
Navigate to: /admin/batches
Action: Create batches and assign them to subjects
Example:
- "Math Batch 2024" → "Mathematics" (ABC College)
- "Physics Batch 2024" → "Physics" (ABC College)
Result: Batches inherit college from their subject
```

#### **Step 6: Create Subscription Plans**
```
Navigate to: /admin/subscription-plans
Action: Create subscription plans with pricing
Example:
- "Basic Plan" → ₹1000 → 6 months
- "Premium Plan" → ₹2000 → 12 months
- "Gold Plan" → ₹3000 → 12 months
Result: Plans available for student subscription

## **🎯 DETAILED TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:**

### **📊 Database Relationships:**

```typescript
// 1. BatchSubscriptionAssignment (Many-to-Many)
{
  batch: ObjectId,           // Reference to Batch
  subscriptionPlan: ObjectId, // Reference to SubscriptionPlan
  college: ObjectId,         // Reference to College
  assignedBy: ObjectId,      // Super Admin who made assignment
  isActive: boolean,
  assignmentDate: Date
}

// 2. Exam.assignedBatches (Many-to-Many)
{
  assignedBatches: [ObjectId] // Array of Batch IDs
}

// 3. StudentSubscription (Student's active subscription)
{
  student: ObjectId,         // Reference to User
  plan: ObjectId,           // Reference to SubscriptionPlan
  status: 'active' | 'expired',
  startDate: Date,
  endDate: Date
}
```

### **🔄 Access Control Logic:**

```typescript
// Student Exam Access Algorithm:
1. Get student's active subscription
2. Get subscription plan from subscription
3. Get all batches assigned to that plan (BatchSubscriptionAssignment)
4. Get all exams assigned to those batches (Exam.assignedBatches)
5. Show only those exams to student
```
