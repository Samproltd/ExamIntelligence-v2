- Analyze the existing code structure and logic before suggesting changes.
- Preserve the current design, including file organization, component patterns, and data flows, unless explicitly requested to refactor.
- Only enhance or add functionality as specified, avoiding unnecessary rewrites.
- If a change risks altering existing behavior, explain the impact and suggest minimal adjustments.

Example:
When adding a new API route:
- Keep the existing route structure in `@app/api`.
- Reuse existing error-handling patterns from `@app/api/utils/error.ts`.
- Do not modify unrelated routes or logic.
