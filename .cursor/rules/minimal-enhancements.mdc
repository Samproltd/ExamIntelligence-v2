- Suggest the smallest possible changes to achieve the requested feature or fix.
- Avoid modifying unrelated code, such as unchanged components, hooks, or database queries.
- When enhancing code, maintain existing TypeScript types, React component props, and MongoDB schema patterns.
- If unsure about the scope, ask for clarification before proposing changes.

Example:
When adding a new field to a form:
- Update only the relevant component in `@components/forms`.
- Reuse existing validation logic from `@lib/validation`.
- Do not alter the formâ€™s styling or submission logic unless specified.
