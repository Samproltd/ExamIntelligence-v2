- Follow the existing component structure: props interface at the top, named export, and styles at the bottom.
- Reuse existing hooks from `@hooks` and utilities from `@lib` where applicable.
- Avoid altering unrelated component logic or styles when adding new features.
- Maintain existing state management patterns (e.g., React hooks or context).

Example:
When adding a new feature to a component:
- Use the pattern in `@components/Button.tsx`.
- Keep existing props and state unchanged unless specified.
- Do not modify styles in `@styles` unless requested.
