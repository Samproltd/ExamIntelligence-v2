- Follow the existing Next.js app router structure in `@app`.
- Reuse error-handling and response patterns from `@app/api/utils`.
- Ensure new routes or pages integrate with existing middleware from `@middleware`.
- Do not modify unrelated routes or middleware unless explicitly requested.

Example:
When adding a new API route:
- Place it in `@app/api` following existing folder patterns.
- Use the response helper from `@app/api/utils/response.ts`.
- Avoid changing existing routes or middleware logic.
