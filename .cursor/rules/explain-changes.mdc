- Provide a brief explanation of why a change is suggested, especially if it modifies existing code.
- Highlight how the change preserves or enhances functionality.
- Suggest tests or checks to verify that existing behavior is unaffected.
- If a change is significant, propose it as an optional refactor with clear benefits.

Example:
When suggesting a new feature:
- Explain: "This adds a filter to the list component to support sorting, reusing the existing state logic."
- Suggest: "Test the list rendering to ensure existing items display correctly."
